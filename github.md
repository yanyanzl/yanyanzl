- At the heart of GitHub is an open-source version control system (VCS) called Git. 
- Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer.

2. Setting your username in Git: Git uses a username to associate commits with an identity. The Git username is not the same as your GitHub username.
     - Setting your Git username for every repository on your computer: git config --global user.name "yanyanzl"
     - Setting your Git username for a single repository: Change the current working directory to the local repository where you want to configure the name that is associated with your Git commits. then : git config user.name "yanyanzl"
4. connect
